# Data Dictionary Extensions

## Enhancing SchemaCrawler Output

SchemaCrawler can display view, stored procedure and function definitions, trigger information, and check constraints by using data from a database's data dictionary views. Views currently processed by SchemaCrawler are shown below. Any additional columns from these views will be available using the getAttribute method on the SchemaCrawler Java objects.

To get SchemaCrawler to use the views, you will need to modify your SchemaCrawler configuration file located in `config/schemacrawler.config.properties`. For example, if you want to get view definitions in the schema output, you would create a property in your 
`schemacrawler.config.properties` file like this:

```
select.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS=\
  SELECT \
    * \
  FROM \
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SYSTEM_VIEWS
```

## Additional Metadata

### Additional Metadata in SchemaCrawler Output

SchemaCrawler saves any additional metadata from the view queries as attibutes on the SchemaCrawler Java objects. You can access the attributes with `getAttribute`. You can also define your own queries to define additional attributes.

### ADDITIONAL_INFO.ADDITIONAL_TABLE_ATTRIBUTES

If you create a query definition in the configuration properties, called `select.ADDITIONAL_INFO.ADDITIONAL_TABLE_ATTRIBUTES`, the columns will be automatically added to table metadata as attributes. The query should return the following columns:

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| TABLE_CATALOG | The name of the catalog containing the table or view. |
| TABLE_SCHEMA | The name of the schema containing the table or view. |
| TABLE_NAME | The name of the table or view. |
| ... additional columns | Any additional values that should be added to the table metadata. | 


### ADDITIONAL_INFO.ADDITIONAL_COLUMN_ATTRIBUTES

If you create a query definition in the configuration properties, called `select.ADDITIONAL_INFO.ADDITIONAL_COLUMN_ATTRIBUTES`, the columns will be automatically added to the column metadata as attributes. The query should return the following columns:

| Column name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| TABLE_CATALOG | The name of the catalog containing the table or view. |
| TABLE_SCHEMA | The name of the schema containing the table or view. |
| TABLE_NAME | The name of the table or view. |
| COLUMN_NAME | The name of the table column. |
| ... additional columns | Any additional values that should be added to the column metadata. |
